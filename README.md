# Project 4:  Brevet time calculator with Ajax

Reimplement the RUSA ACP controle time calculator with flask and ajax.

## ACP controle times

That's "controle" with an 'e', because it's French, although "control"
is also accepted.  Controls are points where   
a rider must obtain proof of passage, and control[e] times are the
minimum and maximum times by which the rider must  
arrive at the location.   

The algorithm for calculating controle times is described at
https://rusa.org/octime_alg.html .  Additional background information
is in https://rusa.org/pages/rulesForRiders . The description is ambiguous,
but the examples help.  Part of finishing this project is clarifying
anything that is not clear about the requirements, and documenting it
clearly.  

We are essentially replacing the calculator at
https://rusa.org/octime_acp.html .  We can also use that calculator
to clarify requirements and develop test data.  


//follow the rules of ACP controle times.
//according different distance(km), proper open and close time will be present.
